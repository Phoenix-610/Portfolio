# 🌟 Personal Portfolio - Phoenix

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, creatively themed around **Minecraft** 🎮 and **Dragon Ball Z** ⚡ to reflect both a love for retro gaming and high-powered anime aesthetics. This site showcases my projects, skills, and journey using immersive 3D visuals and dynamic animations.

## 🎨 Theme

- 🟫 **Minecraft-Inspired UI**: Chunky blocks, pixel-style visuals, and boxy layout resembling Minecraft’s iconic design.
- 🟠 **Dragon Ball Z Vibes**: Fonts, bold colors, and Saiyan-themed energy animations power up the site like a Super Saiyan transformation.
